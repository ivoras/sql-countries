sql-countries
=============

The `countries.sql` file is a SQL script which creates a table containing
a list of countries, their ISO codes, an indicator of using the metric system,
ordering of fields in date strings and if they are using the 24 hour time
system.

This is a somewhat "lazy" list with regards to date and time orderings,
created using the following guidelines:

 * Use DMY as the default, even for countries which officially offer a choice
   of other systems (i.e. if a country standardizes both DMY and YMD, use DMY)
 * Use 24 as the default if a country standardizes on both 24h and 12h time

The rest of the data are official and unambigous.

The table definition is as follows:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE countries (
  name varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  iso2 varchar(2) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  iso3 varchar(3) NOT NULL,
  msystem char(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'M',         -- Metric system: M for Metric, I for imperial
  dformat char(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'DMY',       -- Date format: DMY or MDY or YMD
  tformat char(2) NOT NULL DEFAULT '24'         -- Time format: 24 or 12
);
```

The 2-letter ISO code is the primary key, and it should be used when storing
country data in other tables.
